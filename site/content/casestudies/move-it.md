## Background

Hospitalization is a common occurrence for older adults; approximately 6.8 million Medicare seniors experience an admission for acute care in any given year. Adequate physical activity post-hospitalization is a key component of functional recovery and participation in society. The objective in the Mobility and Outcomes for Validated Evidence â€“ Incentive Trial (MOVE IT) study is to examine the impact of a gamification intervention with social support that uses insights from behavioral economics to increase physical activity among general medical and oncology patients in the 13- weeks post-hospital discharge using a wearable device to track physical activity.

## Intervention and Design

The MOVE IT study is a two-arm, randomized, controlled trial with a 13-week intervention period following hospital discharge. All participants receive $150 for enrolling in the trial, $150 for completing the 13-week post-discharge intervention period and surveys.

**Intervention** - Participants are randomly assigned to the control arm or the gamification arm designed to motivate participants to increase physical activity through gamification with social support. Both arms receive physical activity step-goals and use a wrist-worn wearable device (Withings Steel) to track step counts, but the gamification arm also receives the game-based supportive social incentives.

**Main Outcomes and Measures** - The primary outcome is change in mean daily step count from the baseline period (1-week post-discharge) to the intervention period (weeks 2 to 13 post-discharge) measured using the Withings Steel wrist-worn wearable device. Secondary outcomes include 30-day hospital readmission and functional decline from admission to 13-weeks post-discharge measured using the following validated patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures.

## Way to Health Use

* **Study Enrollment**: Enroll and randomize participants in the study
* **Device Integration**: Collect step data from participants' pedometers
* **Financial Incentives**: Provide participants with incentives for meeting step goals
* **Gamification**: Give participants points and levels based on step goal adherence
