subtitle: Way To Health specific documents & templates for IRB submission
introduction: All research studies need to submit documentation around the appropriate policies and procedures implemented to protect the rights and welfare of humans participating as subjects in the research. To accomplish this purpose, IRBs use a group process to review research protocols and related materials (e.g., informed consent documents and investigator brochures) to ensure protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects of research. For research studies using the Way To Health platform, we have prepared a set of documents and templates to accompany the submission.

      description: >
        Policy to share with the IRB: The Way to Health Team supports all research studies run on the platform. Default views within the platform for all WTH staff display de-identified participant data. As a part of support and troubleshooting, the WTH team is trained to use only these de-identified views. In rare cases where the issue involves viewing identifiable participant data, the WTH team may need to view this data to assist the study team.

    - name: Informed Consent 
      description: >
        To ensure that study participants understand and are willing to participate in your study. Prospective participants in your research study must understand the purpose, the procedures, the potential risks and benefits of their involvement, and their alternatives to participation. WTH now offers on platform signatures using a mouse or the participant can sign with their finger on touch screen devices. This can be configured to be added to the end of a consent internal survey. Please contact your Way To Health account manager for more information or check the user guide for more details.
