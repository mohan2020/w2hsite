title: Working in telemedicine during the age of COVID-19
date: '2020-08-31'
summary: >-
  2020 has led to many changes— transitioning to remote work being one of them.
  Many of us are still getting used to our new reality of telecommuting with
  about half of employed adults currently working from home. Telecommuting has
  been on the rise over the last several years and has accelerated exponentially
  since the pandemic first began. Drawing a direct parallel to this, the field
  of telemedicine has had a similar claim to fame. Put these two together and
  working on telemedicine programs for a health system in the midst of a
  pandemic can be a whole other ball game. I sat down with some integral members
  of the Way to Health Team to talk about the COVID-19 pandemic and just how
  it’s impacted their work here at Way to Health.

_Has your work become more meaningful in any way?_

My focus has been more research so it’s always been impactful work with the goal of improving patient behaviors to in turn, improve health. Working on COVID focused projects allows us to see how we are impacting patients directly while trying to help make clinicians' lives easier. It is definitely much more rewarding and meaningful to see the direct impact our work is having on patients and providers. We’ve also been getting patient feedback once programs have completed to see if the program is effective and helpful. 

_Have you identified any areas in your work that have been fast-tracked or accelerated with quicker input/output time compared to pre-pandemic structure?_

We’ve adopted a much quicker output time —  we’re now building programs, testing and launching them in a matter of days. Before, we launched programs over a span of weeks or months and now we’re iterating much more quickly than we've ever done before. We have a high number of patient enrollments, providers and clinicians constantly looking at data so our user and patient experience is happening at a quicker pace, and consequently we are learning a lot from the huge volume of data. 

_What makes the service Way to Health provides unique?_

Way to Health is really set apart from our competition due to a couple factors. We have seamless integration with EPIC that makes it easy for providers to enroll patients into different programs. Since we’ve been around for so long, we have a ton of experience with what works and what patients respond to in texting and remote monitoring programs. We have the ability to integrate with connected care devices —  this makes a huge impact, and we have the data and metrics to show just how successful it can be.

_Have you identified any areas in your work that have been fast-tracked or accelerated with quicker input/output time compared to pre-pandemic structure?_

From a developer point of view, we’ve created a whole new ticket type for fast tracking work. Our normal flow puts us through a test environment, but now we usually go straight to production. This felt odd at first and took some getting used to. 

_What is one silver lining you have noticed amongst all the uncertainty and unrest?_

One silver lining I’ve noticed is that a lot of red tape got cut away. People are focusing on what we need to do to get care to the people who need it most. I think everyone realized there was a need and started asking, “How can we actually do this?” For instance, integrating with Lancaster General Hospital usually would’ve taken 1-2 months to get approval up the chain whereas now, it happened in a week. Everyone’s coming together to recognize that need for care and how we can get things done quickly.

_Shifting to remote work - how has the operational response and needs of HUP & other clients impacted your work? What does your “new normal” look like?_

Since we already had occasional remote work we had the tools in place in terms of Slack and Zoom and knowing how to communicate with each other. Our COVID Watch program would normally have taken a few months of working with stakeholders, clinical partners, implementation, and product development, but it took 2.5 weeks instead. In the past we’ve had to scramble to get things done, but now the order of magnitude speeds up the process. For example, a lot of decisions we’ve agonized over now due to time constraints we go forward with what works. And we find solutions that don’t put our other projects at risk. 

_Has your work become more meaningful in any way?_

We have always done a combination of research and clinical work. With COVID Watch, we are much closer to patients and patient-specific needs. Normally we’re looking for an elegant solution that meets lots of people's needs, or we stop to consider heavily what clinicians and patients want. Now it's more like, “Here's the specific problem these people are having, and how do we solve it?” In the past we haven't really been involved in running programs. We just support the program and help it launch. With COVID Watch, we’re intimately involved with tracking data daily and closely monitoring what our patients are doing. We can say they're our patients when in the past they’ve been likened to our “customers.” It’s definitely more meaningful.

_If the economy takes a serious hit, how does it impact our customers?_

It will impact us across the board. If you look at our client base, anything research-related will continue as usual, since there are lots of NIH grants to sponsor. As long as we are front and center in submissions, we will do well. Research volume is definitely going to go up. If you look at our clients, we work with major health systems. Health plans for a while now have had an increasing amount of interest. We should be in good shape, but the healthcare industry might take a hit.

_What big opportunities exist for W2H born out of this situation?_

We are in the process of pulling together the next big set of projects. We’ve been receiving requests from everyone asking about the work we’ve done, and this challenges us to keep moving forward. And we will keep moving forward and do what we’re doing really well. In general, we will be able to establish closer ties with internal Penn teams to be aligned with them so they can look upon us as partners.
