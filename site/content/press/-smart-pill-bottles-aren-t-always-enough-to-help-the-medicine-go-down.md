  Still, Volpp remains optimistic about pill bottle technology â€” he just thinks
  the high-tech strategy needs to be paired with social interventions. In his
  study the results were better for patients who had their pill bottle
  automatically alert a friend if they missed a dose. But when it comes to
  getting people to take their medications, it looks like a smart bottle is no
  magic pill.
