        Communication with patients and / or study participants is key to engaging them in their health. You can choose from a variety of communication techniques or combine them in interesting ways tailored to a patient's behavior. Options include two-way texting, surveys, web and mobile apps and more.

      header: Clinical Trials
      text: >
        There are plenty of clinical trials management software (CTMS) solutions out there. However, they are either built for pharmaceutical / drug discovery (Velos, Oncore etc.) or are very general purpose (e.g. Redcap). Way To Health is a tool purpose built to design and deploy behavioral change and interventional (bedside to home) research.

      header: Behavioral Economics
      text: >
        We believe technology assisted motivation and human behavior change is the key to advancing health outcomes. Behavioral economics is one of the most promising methods to change behavior. Various social and financial incentives are pre-built and available in the platform.

      header: Gamification
      text: >
        Given recent trends, it is safe to assume that games and social media are significant drivers of human behavior. The platform allows patients to earn points, level up, use lifelines and more. Now combine this with peers or support partners and the results can be eye-opening.

      text: >
        In the research context, interventions are invariably unique. In the clinical context, interventions need to be targeted and personalized to be effective. The Way To Health platform provides a flexible rules engine with easy configuration driven by data captured from patients via communications or devices.
