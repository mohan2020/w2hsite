introduction: >
  Mix and match features to tailor interventions for desired outcomes

patientcommunication:
  featureset: Patient Communication
  header: Communication with patients and / or study participants is key to engaging them in their health. You can choose from a variety of communication techniques or combine them in interesting ways tailored to a patient's behavior

      feature: Two way Texting
      text: >
        Texting (SMS) has repeatedly been demonstrated to be a very effective way of communicating with patients since it works irrespective of the kind of phone the patient has. Texts can be sent out based on set schedules and / or rules. These configuration rules can be as simple as responding with a personalized "Great job, John Appleseed" or as complex as evaluating blood pressure values and responding with an provider or nurse alert

      feature: Integrated Survey Management
      text: >
        In cases where more data needs to be collected (demographics, symptoms, etc.), the system offers the ability to create a survey. You can either integrate the survey with Qualtrics or create your own survey from scratch using the built-in survey creation and deployment tool. These surveys can be sent out to patients based on specific schedules and simple or complex rules.

deviceintegration:
  featureset: Device Integration
  header: Healthcare data is overwhelming and complex. We provide direct integrations into a range of devices including Electronic Health Records (EHRs) so your team can focus on innovation, efficiency, and outcomes. We capture remotely collected health data simply and seamlessly into our system, enabling scalable, integrated and personalized initiatives

      feature: Vitals and activity Monitoring
      text: >
        The platform integrates directly with a number of biomedical devices to capture vitals directly from the patient / participant. The kinds of vitals captured include blood pressure, medication adherence, sleep tracking, weight, blood glucose and many more continue to be added. Additional devices are added quickly on request.

      feature: EHR Integrations
      text: > 
        It is our belief that EHRs should be the system of record for all patient data. Additionally, any provider action needed should also be done via the EHR. With this in mind, the platform provides bi-directional integration currently with Epic (and additional EHRs on request).

rct:
  featureset: Randomized Controlled Trials
  header: There are plenty of clinical trials management software (CTMS) solutions out there. However, they are either built for pharmaceutical / drug discovery (Velos, Oncore etc.) or are very general purpose (e.g. Redcap). Way To Health is a tool purpose built to design and deploy behavioral change and interventional (bedside to home) research .

      header: NIH and Grant Reputation
      text: >
        Way to Health has demonstrated its value as a research platform in this domain by supporting over 80 trials and $45 million in funding.Â  The platform, past and current Principal Investigators (PIs) and its uses have credibility among the research and funding communities.

      header: Arms & Randomization
      text: >
        Setup multiple arms for studies including a control arm. The platform also offers multiple computerized randomization of participants, including the configurable choices for stratified, blocked, weighted, and adaptive randomization strategies. Ongoing management of participants via a "triage" view is also available out-of-the-box. 

be:
  featureset: Behavioral Economics
  header: We believe technology assisted motivation & human behavior change is the key to advancing health outcomes. Behavioral economics is one of the most promising methods to change behavior. Various social and financial incentives are pre-built and available in the platform.

      header: Financial Incentives
      text: >
        Lotteries, loss and gain framed incentives and much more can be easily applied to activities - steps, weighings, pretty much any data gathered by the platform from any data source. Apply different strategies to different populations and depending on the type of activity.

      header: Gamification & Social
      text: > 
        Games and social media are significant drivers of human behavior. The platform allows patients to earn points, level up, use lifelines and more. These features can be combined with peer competition or support.

rulesengine:
  featureset: Rules Engine
  header: Interventions need to be targeted and personalized to be effective. The Way To Health platform provides a flexible rules engine with easy configuration driven by data captured from patients via communications or devices.

      iconcolor: "#49A078"
      header: Schedule driven
      text: >
        All interventions require recurrence based on a defined period - hours, days, weeks or months. Research studies or clinical deployments both require this to be further tailored by each arm or patient. The platform has been designed to support these use cases and more.  
    - icon: exclamation
      iconcolor: "#49A078"
      header: Alerts & Incidents
      text: > 
         The Way To Health platform allows for the creation of incidents whenever certain criteria ("exception criteria") are met. Configure notifications depending on the users role.
